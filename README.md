## Projects
Here are some of the projects I have worked on:

1. **[Portfolio Next.js](https://github.com/FreitasGilberto/portfolio-next):** A personal portfolio website built using Next.js, showcasing my skills, projects, and achievements. The portfolio is designed to provide an intuitive and visually appealing experience to visitors.

2. **[Sticky Notes Web App](https://github.com/FreitasGilberto/sticky-notes):** An interactive web application developed using HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript. This app allows users to create and manage virtual sticky notes, providing a convenient and digital way to organize tasks, reminders, and important information.

3. **[Día de San Valentín Wep App](https://github.com/FreitasGilberto/para-teo):** Static web project I created to ask a special question on Valentine's Day to my loved one. The page presents a simple question "Do you want to be my Valentine?" with buttons to answer "Yes" or "No".
